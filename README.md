# collegeProjects
This repository is dedicated to all the projects which are done while I was pursuing my BCA Graduation, I had two project papers in my syllabus of BCA, first one was in fourth semester (as Minor Project) and the other one in sixth semester. For the first one (i.e. Minor Project) I made a clone website of Suzuki Motorcycles India Pvt. Ltd. using HTML, CSS JavaScript and PHP and for sixth semester project I made an Android Game called “Fishie”.
