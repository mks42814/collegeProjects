# collegeProjects

This repository is dedicated to all the projects that I completed while working toward my BCA degree. My BCA course syllabus included two project papers, the first of which was due in the fourth semester (as a Minor Project) and the second of which was due in the sixth semester. Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, I created a replica of the Suzuki Motorcycles India Pvt. Ltd. website for the first project (a minor project), and for the sixth semester project, I created the Android game "Fishie."
